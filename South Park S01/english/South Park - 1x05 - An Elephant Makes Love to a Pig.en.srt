1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,790
And now, a fireside chat
with the creators of South Park:

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,600
Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,410
- I'm Trey Parker.
- I'm Matt Stone.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,420
And this is old Scratch.
Say hi, old fellow!

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,250
This episode is
"An Elephant Fucks a Pig."

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,760
It was changed to
"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig."

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,390
Which is silly.
If an elephant was on a pig...

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,050
...it wouldn't be making love,
it would be fucking it.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,460
Would you agree this episode confirms
Matt and Trey are sick weirdoes?

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,910
What is sick and wrong about two beings
sharing the most intimate of moments?

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,480
Do you come at the gene splicing
of DNA from personal experience?

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,380
Yes. I made Trey from splicing
a tomato and a flounder.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,050
Do you have strong ethical views on
whether we should tamper with nature?

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,320
Matt and I think genetic
engineering is great.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,430
Everything should be spliced
with everything.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,040
That's the way we'll become
perfect beings. Right, old Scratch?

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,070
We should splice pigs with
elephants, tomatoes with apples.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,910
l, myself, would like to be spliced
with Fiona Apple.

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,580
And so now, sit back, relax, and enjoy
"An Elephant Fucks a Pig."

20
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,650
An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,220
- Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
- Nothing, I mean nowhere.

22
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,830
- Your sister beat you up again?
- No!

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,860
Your sister kicked your ass!

24
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,700
She's pissed she got headgear.
She takes it out on me.

25
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,240
You get your butt kicked by a girl.

26
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,670
I'd never let a woman kick my ass.
If she tried anything, I'd be:

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,040
"Get your bitch-ass back in the
kitchen and make me some pie!"

28
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,120
My parents don't believe me.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,410
They think she's innocent.
She's an evil bitch.

30
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,820
Be a man, Stan. Just say, "Hey, woman!
You shut your mouth and make babies!"

31
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,120
What's that elephant doing?

32
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,200
You mean this one?
He's my new pet elephant.

33
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,860
- Where'd you get that?
- Mail order from Africa.

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,940
They said it'd take 6 weeks,
but it only took 3!

35
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,970
- Wow, that's cool!
- It's not!

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,440
Mom won't let him in the house!
His poop is bigger than our couch.

37
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,610
That's why my mom got me a potbellied
pig because its poop is small.

38
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,190
Yeah, but pigs aren't smart
like elephants.

39
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,990
Hey! Wait a minute!
What is that thing?

40
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,760
This is the new retarded kid.

41
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,160
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl.
But you still can't get on.

42
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,930
You have to take the special-ed bus!

43
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,070
Looks like you're not welcome
anywhere. See you!

44
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,110
If a woman ever gave me crap,
I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry!"

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,120
- Sit down, kid!
- Yes, ma'am.

46
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,520
Children, our friend Mr. Hat is going
to tell us all about genetic engineering.

47
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,630
That's right, Mr. Garrison, genetic
engineering is an exciting new science.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,600
You can splice DNA from some
animals and make them better.

49
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,560
- Mr. Garrison?
- Yes, Kyle.

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,330
Can you make an elephant smaller?

51
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,130
Well, yes, I suppose you could.

52
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,440
You could splice elephant genes with
a dog or cat or potbellied pig genes.

53
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,850
Combine my elephant with a potbellied
pig and make potbellied elephants.

54
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,480
- Smart like elephants, small like pigs.
- Cool!

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,520
- I want a potbellied elephant.
- I'll pay $50.

56
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,680
That's stupid.

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,730
Shut up!
We can genetical engineer anything.

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,800
I bet I could clone a human being
before you cross an elephant and a pig.

59
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,990
- I'll bet you can't!
- Watch me!

60
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,570
Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.
Two A+ students in a cloning war.

61
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,270
Genetic engineering lets us correct
God's horrible mistakes.

62
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,710
Like German people.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
You might visit the genetic-engineering
ranch outside of town for help.

64
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,950
You could use this for your
science-fair projects next month.

65
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,090
- Genetic-engineering ranch? Sweet!
- We need a pig.

66
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,720
- We can use Cartman's pig.
- Leave Fluffy out of this!

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,030
We won't hurt her.
We need blood.

68
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,430
You're not using Fluffy's blood!
I'll kick you in the nuts!

69
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,630
Kyle, no!

70
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,100
Can I talk to you for a minute?

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,710
I couldn't help notice that black eye.
Are there problems at home?

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.

73
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,390
Here, sit down, have some cocoa,
and tell Mr. Hat all about it.

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm your friend Mr. Hat. You can
tell me anything. Now, who hit you?

75
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,120
- Is it your father or your mother?
- Neither, it's my sister.

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,630
Your sister? For Pete's sake,
don't be such a wuss!

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with little
problems and give me back my cocoa!

78
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,500
Let's open the phone lines
for questions.

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,010
Hey!

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,050
- Hi, Shelly.
- You looking at my headgear?

81
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,590
What headgear?

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,420
- You looking at my headgear?
- I didn't really notice.

83
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,460
- You little liar!
- I think it looks terrific! It matches...

84
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,980
- Ready to go?
- Go where?

85
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,850
The genetics ranch. To splice
the pig's genes with my elephant.

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,250
Nobody's splicing from Fluffy!

87
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,620
- I swear I'm gonna kill you, Stan!
- Why is your sister so mean?

88
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,390
If some sissy chick tried
to kick my ass, I'd be like:

89
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,700
"Hey, missy, why don't you go knit me a
sweater before I slap you in the face!"

90
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,430
Who said that?

91
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,340
This must be it.

92
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,070
Looks like nobody's home.
We should come another time.

93
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,520
We're splicing Fluffy
and my elephant together.

94
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,950
I won't let them hurt you.

95
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,610
- It's just a pig.
- Quit being a baby.

96
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,230
- I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
- At least I'm not a pig-f* * * er!

97
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm taking my pig. Screw you guys!
I'm going home!

98
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,030
This whole idea is stupid!

99
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,830
What would you know?
You never get higher than a D!

100
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,640
Why don't you go to San Francisco
with the other Jews?

101
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,640
There's no Jews
in San Francisco, retard!

102
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,800
I'll kick you in the nuts!

103
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,510
Can I help you?

104
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,790
Yeah. We wanna crossbreed
an elephant with a pig.

105
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,410
Brilliant idea.
Huge, elephant-sized pigs.

106
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,620
No, little potbellied elephants
that people can keep as pets.

107
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,030
That's an even better idea.
Come on in.

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,260
I'm so pleased that you're interested
in genetic engineering.

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,340
Nobody will hurt you.

110
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,100
Thanks to genetic engineering,
there will be an end...

111
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,410
...to hunger, disease,
pollution, even war.

112
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,380
I created things
to make the world better.

113
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,580
For instance,
here's a monkey with four asses.

114
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,420
- How does that make the world better?
- My four-assed ostrich.

115
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,290
My four-assed mongoose.

116
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,330
Have anything
besides four-assed animals?

117
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,800
I suppose so. Yes, over here.

118
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,230
I have rats spliced with ducks,
gorillas spliced with mosquitoes.

119
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,430
Here, I have rabbits spliced with fish
to make little bunny fish.

120
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,370
These bunny ears are
tied on with strings!

121
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,780
Here, Swiss cheese spliced
with chalk and a beard.

122
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,620
- What about our potbellied elephant?
- Well, I'm sorry, children.

123
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,780
Pig and elephant DNA won't splice.
Have you heard that song by Loverboy?

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,950
Which song?

125
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,770
Maybe I can help you add
a few asses to that swine.

126
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,000
Keep your hands off of Fluffy!

127
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,510
It's amazing what we can do
with a little blood sample these days.

128
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,540
- What? Excuse me.
- Why are you taking Stan's blood?

129
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,770
Pardon me, I tripped.
Could I have some hair?

130
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,050
- Watch out, genetic engineers are crazy!
- Come on, Fluffy!

131
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,150
- This gas is hurting my anus.
- That's pretty fresh.

132
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,120
I sure am hungry.

133
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,390
Any of you blokes know
what's for lunch today?

134
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,930
- Lunchy munchies?
- Go away, Pip, nobody likes you!

135
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,040
What kind of a name is Pip?

136
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,970
My father's family name being Pirrip
and my name, Phillip...

137
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,340
Would you shut up?
Nobody gives a rat's ass!

138
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,110
- Yeah, go away, Pip.
- Right.

139
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,740
French people piss me off.

140
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,220
Dumb asses! You give up
on your stupid science-fair project?

141
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,390
- No, we're already halfway done.
- Then all you've got is a stupid pig.

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,690
- Probably a gay pig.
- It's more than you've got!

143
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,890
Wrong! We've already
got our human clone under way.

144
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,270
Oh, my God! They cloned a foot!

145
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,700
Hey, I'll kick your ass!

146
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,950
By Friday, we'll clone a whole human.
Good luck with your pig.

147
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,550
Hello, children.

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
- How you doing?
- Bad.

149
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,410
Why bad?

150
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,110
A pig and an elephant's
genes won't splice.

151
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,020
Of course they won't splice, children.

152
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,190
Haven't you ever heard
that song by Loverboy?

153
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:41,240
- A pig-elephant? That's not a bad idea.
- I told you guys.

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,530
Imagine a pint-sized elephant
that you could keep in the house.

155
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,040
Children, we could make
a fortune with this.

156
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,800
You hear? We'll be rich!

157
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,610
Forget about that genetic engineering.

158
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,150
If you want to combine a pig and an
elephant, get them to make sweet love.

159
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,480
An elephant won't make love
to a pig.

160
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,890
My pig won't wanna make love
to that elephant!

161
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,030
Sure they would,
if you get them in the mood.

162
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,530
- How do we do that?
- Do what I do, get them good and drunk.

163
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,670
- Wanna come over?
- We've got work to do.

164
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,570
An elephant takes a while
to get drunk.

165
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,700
- Just for a little bit?
- Your sister gonna kick your ass?

166
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,870
Shut up, Cartman!

167
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,980
- Yeah, she's just a girl.
- Lf a girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be:

168
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,610
"Why don't you stop dressing me like a
mailman and making me dance for you...

169
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,590
...while you smoke crack
in your bedroom...

170
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,720
...and have sex with some guy
I don't even know on my dad's bed."

171
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,130
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm saying you're a little wuss.

172
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,900
Use family love
as a weapon against her.

173
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,640
Next time she kicks your ass, tell her,
"Shelly, you're my sister. I love you."

174
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,840
- Sick, she's my sister!
- Try it. We gotta get Cartman's pig.

175
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,820
You don't! Leave Fluffy out of this!

176
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,820
- Come on, Kenny.
- Kyle, no!

177
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,360
No elephant is gonna make love
to Fluffy! I will kick you in the nuts!

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,020
Crap!

179
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,560
And now back to Jesus and Pals...

180
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,040
- Are you staring at my neck brace?
- No, I mean, yes? What neck brace?

181
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,280
Before you beat my face
into a bloody pulp...

182
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,940
...I just want you to know
that you're my sister and I love you.

183
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,990
Someday I'll be bigger than you.
You'll wish you'd never done this.

184
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,330
You'll never be bigger
than me, Stan. Never!

185
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:55,470
Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful.
My son, I think we've finally done it.

186
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,100
Yes, we have, Dad.
My very own human clone.

187
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,970
- Hope it's not a gay clone.
- Yeah. That's so stupid.

188
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,880
Come on, keep drinking.

189
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,210
I wonder how drunk he needs to be
to make sweet love to the pig.

190
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,420
- Damn it! This won't work!
- Hello, children.

191
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,220
I'm checking to see how our little
entrepreneurial adventure is going.

192
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,960
They're both drunk
but won't have sex!

193
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,400
Children, you can't stick a drunk pig
with a drunk elephant...

194
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,440
...and expect them
to do the mattress mambo.

195
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,440
You need to set the mood. Let me
show you boys what I'm talking about.

196
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Elton John!

197
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,460
Thank you, Elton.

198
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,360
Look, it's working!

199
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,060
Now, children, gather around
and watch the wonders of life.

200
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,140
The beauty of mother nature.

201
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,580
- Sick!
- Fluffy!

202
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,010
Now I know how all those
white women must have felt.

203
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,450
How luscious,
our creature has come to fruition.

204
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,690
- Dad, you're the best.
- Oh, my God! He only has one ass!

205
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,060
He's of no use to me.
I'll have to burn the room.

206
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,390
This entire experiment
is turning out very bad.

207
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,760
Me bad?

208
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,440
He's out of control.
We have to destroy him!

209
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,940
But he's our science-fair project!

210
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,580
- He's too dangerous, son.
- But, Dad, I want a human clone!

211
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,310
Son, no!

212
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,930
You've made a horrible mistake. You put
the people of South Park in jeopardy!

213
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,430
They're all stupid anyway.
Come on, guys, let's go.

214
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,230
They're all gay.

215
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,200
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

216
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,740
They will.
It's gonna be one ugly sight.

217
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,780
- I thought nature was beautiful.
- When does it go from beautiful to ugly?

218
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,310
Usually about 9:30 a.m., children.

219
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,110
Here we go.

220
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,520
There's nothing worse than getting
drunk and waking up next to a pig.

221
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,300
- Or an elephant.
- How do we know if she's pregnant?

222
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,130
We might not know
for a couple of days.

223
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,900
Couple of days? Terrance
will have his clone tomorrow.

224
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,270
Good job, Einstein!
Why don't we build a rocket?

225
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,280
Thank Buddha I found you.

226
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,380
Tell me,
have you seen anything odd lately?

227
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,780
An elephant have sex with a pig.

228
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,620
- No, I said odd.
- You're that crazy cracker from the hill.

229
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,350
Sir, if making mutant animals spliced
with humans is crazy, then...

230
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,300
Never mind.
There's been an incident at the ranch.

231
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:54,410
I created a large mutant clone of that
little boy there, and he's broken free.

232
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,910
- A version of me?
- Bigger than a regular clone?

233
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,680
He's dangerous. His brain is identical
to yours. I need you to help me find him.

234
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,250
Stan, are you wearing a different hat?

235
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,030
Hey! I know a certain young
man who's itching for detention!

236
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,100
How big is he?
I bet he weighs 400 pounds!

237
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,640
Come on, Stan, don't you know
where you would go?

238
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,240
Oh, my God!

239
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,820
It appears that the destructive creature
is 8-year-old Stan Marsh of South Park.

240
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,350
Asked why he was wreaking
havoc on his hometown...

241
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,860
...the little boy replied simply,
"Me Stan..."

242
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,620
Back to the studio.

243
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,890
Police request
that if you see this boy...

244
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,370
...you immediately kill him
and burn his body.

245
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,300
Now back to Jesus and Pals.

246
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,870
The way is paved with gold
for ye who seek truth...

247
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,740
Jesus!

248
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,680
My evil clone is destroying the town.
We have to find him.

249
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,450
You boys watch
The X Files too much.

250
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,790
There's no such thing
as genetic clone...

251
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,720
- Come on, let's go!
- There you are!

252
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,670
You tore up my entire gun shop! You
better have a good explanation for this!

253
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,500
It wasn't me, it was my evil clone.

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,440
What the hell has gotten into you?
You have got severe lunchroom duty!

255
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm gonna have a word
with your father!

256
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,050
- Wait till your father hears about this.
- Wait, Stan, there he goes.

257
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,210
Stop!

258
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,520
- He recognizes you, dude.
- That's good, dude. Just calm down.

259
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,000
What should we do with him?

260
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,800
Stan? How would you like to go home
and meet your sister?

261
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,610
Shelly has a wire in her mouth
and a metal plate on her back.

262
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,650
When you see Shelly, kick her ass.
Shelly very bad!

263
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,790
- Me bad?
- No, Shelly bad. You good.

264
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,120
He's tearing up the house.
Stop him!

265
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,470
What the hell do you want?

266
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,940
- I'm lusciously sorry for everything.
- They got our clone. He belongs to us.

267
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,110
This beast is a disgrace
to genetic engineers everywhere.

268
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm sorry I've caused you
such inconvenience.

269
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,120
I tried to play God and I failed.

270
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,900
Daddy, no!

271
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,760
All I wanted was to genetically
engineer something useful. I failed.

272
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,910
Perhaps we shouldn't toy
with God's creations.

273
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,770
Perhaps we should leave nature alone
to its simple one-assed schematics.

274
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,510
You bastards, this isn't over!
Wait until tomorrow!

275
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,550
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
You bastard!

276
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,820
Mom and Dad are home.
It's a disaster! You gotta help.

277
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,430
I ain't helping. I wanna eat pie.

278
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,530
- You can't leave me here alone!
- Watch me.

279
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,930
We have to find out
if Cartman's pig is pregnant.

280
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,560
- Thanks a lot!
- Oh, boy, you are gonna get it now.

281
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,000
It isn't fair.
Everybody hates me.

282
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,670
The whole town wants me killed.
Mom and Dad are gonna send me away.

283
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,780
I don't wanna be sent away.
I wanna stay here!

284
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,390
What in God's name
have you been doing?

285
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,920
Everybody in town
is upset with you.

286
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,650
What's going on?
Are you on drugs?

287
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,760
It's not Stan's fault.
It wasn't Stan. He was...

288
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,530
He was with me the whole time.

289
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,140
Well, we're sorry
we jumped to conclusions.

290
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,710
Oh, honey.
Please forgive us, son.

291
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,210
Shelly, you saved my life.
And yet you've done so much more.

292
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,410
You taught me the meaning of family.
Families don't get along.

293
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,320
When the forces of evil descend,
we conquer them by sticking together.

294
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,630
Everyone, let's give Casey
and his weed a big hand.

295
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,970
We're ready to see
your science project.

296
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,740
Our pig hasn't given birth.
She should any time now.

297
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,310
I guess you get an F.

298
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,440
Terrance, I know the class
can hardly wait to see yours.

299
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,820
Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students,
for our science-fair project...

300
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,430
...Bill Fossey and I spawned a creature
genetically superior to man.

301
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,120
I present to you
the five-assed monkey.

302
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,830
Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful?

303
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,510
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth!
It had a baby!

304
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,410
- What's it look like?
- Does it look like pig or elephant?

305
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,890
It kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.

306
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,150
Isn't that an amazing coincidence?
What are the odds of that?

307
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,490
You boys get first prize.

308
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,530
That'll do, pig.
