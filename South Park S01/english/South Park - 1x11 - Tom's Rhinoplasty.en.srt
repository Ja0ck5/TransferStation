1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,300
That was a hoot and a holler!
Did you like that, South Parketeers?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,960
You'll love this next episode.
It's our favorite. "Tom's Rhinoplasty."

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,040
Mr. Garrison gets a nose job...

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,010
...a substitute teacher comes
to South Park...

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,480
...and our boys learn
how to lick carpet.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,050
It's our favorite episode because
we got Natasha Henstridge...

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,320
...to be the voice of the substitute
teacher. She was in the movie Species.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,930
We loved her acting.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,120
We used to freeze-frame
a lot of her acting on the VCR...

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,500
...and play with ourselves.
We'd play "I'm Natasha Henstridge."

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,230
I'd close my eyes
and pretend Matt was Natasha...

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,640
...then Matt would pretend
I was Natasha.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,680
But remember, if you play "I'm Natasha
Henstridge" with your friends...

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,820
...play it safe.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,980
Look, it's our friend
Indian Companion.

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,750
Say hi to Indian Companion, kids.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,360
What's happening, Indian Companion?
Someone coming?

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,720
- Someone coming.
- Someone coming. Great.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,120
Thanks.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,500
- Go build a tepee.
- You'll be Natasha Henstridge tonight.

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,660
So sit back, relax and have
a rootin'-tootin' good time...

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,610
...with "Tom's Rhinoplasty." Yee-haw!

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,570
Ready?

24
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,350
Tom's Rhinoplasty

25
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,620
- Stan, it's almost Valentine's Day.
- I know.

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,350
- We should go on a cruise.
- I can't afford a cruise.

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,620
We can make a little boat out of
cardboard and pretend it's a cruise.

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,470
Shut up, Cartman.

29
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,100
That is so lame!

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,210
Then we could dress up in costumes
and pretend we're getting married.

31
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,680
Stop this. You're killing me!

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,590
Children, I have
some difficult news.

33
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,100
Mr. Garrison won't be teaching
for a while. He has to have surgery.

34
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,200
So you're going to have
a substitute teacher.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,210
I want you to show the substitute the
same respect you show Mr. Garrison.

36
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,400
- Yes, little boy?
- We don't respect Mr. Garrison.

37
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,020
Anyhoo, I want you all to meet
your new substitute, Miss Ellen.

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,850
Hello, children.

39
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,760
Wow, she's pretty.

40
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,330
You can say that again.

41
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,200
Good luck. If they get out of control,
just use this tear gas.

42
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,360
Thank you. I'm sure I'll be fine.

43
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,130
I know you must be very upset
about your teacher having surgery.

44
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,400
But I'll try to make things as easy
as possible for all of us.

45
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,950
Stan? Stan?

46
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,080
Now let me try and learn your names.

47
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,410
- You are Eric Cartman?
- Yes, ma'am!

48
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,990
Okay, and you must be Stan Marsh.

49
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,490
Do you need to go to the nurse?

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,460
- No, he pukes when he's in love.
- I'll kick your ass!

51
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,430
So you're all right?

52
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,640
You had waffles for breakfast.

53
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,340
I'm embarrassed about
getting a nose job, Tom.

54
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,340
I told the people at school
I had herpes.

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,510
Mr. Garrison, people have
cosmetic surgery all the time.

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,590
This computer can help you pick
what kind of nose you want.

57
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,890
- Isn't that amazing, Mr. Hat?
- It sure is, Mr. Garrison.

58
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,120
We could go with something smaller,
which would make you look like this:

59
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,090
Or we could straighten out the bridge,
like this:

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,430
- That's not bad.
- We could narrow the bridge...

61
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,770
...which would make you
look more like this:

62
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,880
- That's it, that's the nose I want!
- Alrighty then.

63
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,140
Now, I must warn you, there are risks.

64
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,450
You could wind up a hideous creature,
forced to live in the sewers...

65
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,750
...only emerging at night
to hunt for scraps of food.

66
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,190
- I can live with that.
- Then let's get started.

67
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,470
- She was looking at me, not you.
- How could she help it, fat-ass?

68
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,340
- She was checking me out.
- Until you puked on her.

69
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,500
Hello, children.
What's all this about a new teacher?

70
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,980
- Miss Ellen. She's beautiful.
- Is she Vanessa Williams beautiful...

71
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,680
...or Toni Braxton beautiful?
Or Pamela Anderson beautiful?

72
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,550
Or is she Erin Gray of Buck Rogers
beautiful?

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,630
- Yeah, that one.
- I gotta meet this woman.

74
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,530
Didn't you notice how her left arm
is longer than the right one?

75
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,290
- No.
- Well, it is!

76
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You know what they say about women
with one arm longer than the other.

77
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,240
Right.

78
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,140
Did you notice that mole on her neck
with hair growing out of it?

79
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,910
That's okay. You know what they say
about women with moles on their necks.

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,320
- We're still valentines, right?
- Sure, whatever.

81
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,360
- We should buy Miss Ellen presents.
- We'll go to the mall tonight.

82
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,870
I'm gonna buy her a vacuum cleaner.
Chicks love vacuum cleaners.

83
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,020
Goodness. Would anybody
mind cleaning my erasers?

84
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,390
Me, me, me!

85
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,130
You're so immature!
Act like 8-year-olds.

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,860
- Stan, how about you?
- I'd love to.

87
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,340
Now, let's review
our multiplication tables.

88
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,810
- Cartman?
- What's a multiplication table?

89
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,810
Didn't Mr. Garrison
teach multiplication?

90
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,610
Where did he leave off?

91
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,020
We were learning about how Yasmine
Bleeth is dating Richard Grieco...

92
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,090
...that guy who used to be
on 2 1 Jump Street.

93
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,320
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

94
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,860
- I'm Chef.
- And...?

95
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,270
I stopped by because Kyle forgot
his detergent on the playground.

96
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,430
- My detergent?
- That's not...

97
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,580
Crazy cracker's always
leaving detergent.

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,180
- What was your name?
- Chef's moving in on Miss Ellen.

99
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,540
- I'm the substitute.
- Well, there's no substitute for you.

100
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,520
That's very nice, Mr. Chef.
Now, if you're finished...

101
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,190
We've got to learn that.

102
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,890
That was enthralling.
Could I get back to teaching?

103
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,590
- Lf we could have dinner tonight.
- Fine, just let me do my job.

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
- Chef's gonna make love to Miss Ellen!
- What?

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,780
- Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?
- Where am I?

106
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,970
- The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.
- I feel weak. How do I look?

107
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,090
- You look great.
- I feel kind of nauseous.

108
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,950
That's to be expected.
We did major reconstruction...

109
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,860
...sawed through some bone,
snapped some cartilage.

110
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,760
All the blood and mucus, the sound
of bone and sinew coming apart...

111
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,870
By the way, did you ever
see that movie Contact?

112
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,440
- Stop! That movie was terrible!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison.

113
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,950
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll check on you a little later.

114
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,550
I waited through that entire movie to see
the alien and it was her god damn father.

115
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Remember your homework.
We have a lot of catching up.

116
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,130
- Goodbye, Miss Ellen.
- Stop kissing ass.

117
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,570
- I'm not kissing ass, you slut!
- Miss Ellen, can I talk to you?

118
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,240
Of course, Wendy.

119
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,880
I couldn't help but notice you've
taken a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.

120
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,070
I've taken a liking to all of you.
You're all so cute and full of life.

121
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,050
- Can I tell you something, Miss Ellen?
- Of course, Wendy.

122
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,450
- Don't f* * * with me!
- What?

123
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,290
Stay away from my man, bitch...

124
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,330
...or I'll whup your sorry ass
back to last year!

125
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,160
Bye, Miss Ellen!

126
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,870
I want to thank all you children
for the presents you bought me.

127
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,880
What a delightful scarf!
Thank you, Kyle.

128
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,610
- Loser gift, loser gift.
- And here's one from Kenny.

129
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,020
Thank you very much, Kenny. This is
a very scrumptious-Iooking sausage.

130
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,750
And what a nice alarm clock!
Thank you, Stan.

131
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,600
And here's another present,
from Wendy.

132
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,330
Why, it's a dead animal.
Thank you, Wendy.

133
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,710
- She liked mine the best.
- Where's yours, Cartman?

134
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,110
I got Miss Ellen a chocolate pie,
but I left it at home.

135
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,680
Okay, kids, we're gonna take
a spelling test now.

136
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,850
But as an extra incentive...

137
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,050
...I'm gonna take whoever gets
the highest score to dinner.

138
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,890
- I wish I knew how to spell.
- Are there any questions?

139
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,630
- Yes, Wendy?
- When someone gets as old as you...

140
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,430
...do they have to wear
Depend undergarments?

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,670
I aced that test.
I'm gonna win that dinner.

142
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,400
No, you're not.

143
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,980
- Hi, Stan.
- I bet I scored 1 00.

144
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,480
- Hi, Stan!
- Oh, hi, Wendy.

145
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,020
Miss Ellen was just in the bathroom
taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.

146
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,020
- No, she wasn't.
- She was!

147
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,890
- That's impossible.
- And she has horrible gas too.

148
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,650
She says she can't control it.

149
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,630
It smelled like a dead calf
rotting in the hot sun.

150
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,200
Wendy, you need to stop
with this jealousy thing.

151
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,810
- Yeah, you're acting like a freak.
- No, I'm not acting like a freak!

152
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,850
Someone's gotta pull that monkey
out of her ass.

153
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,750
- Hello there.
- Hey, Chef.

154
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,480
- How did your date go?
- Not too good.

155
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,150
- Didn't you make sweet love to her?
- No, she's not like that.

156
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,760
How do I put this?

157
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,830
Miss Ellen doesn't exactly play
for the right team.

158
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,400
In other words, children...

159
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,030
...she's not a member
of the heterosexual persuasion.

160
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,180
- Understand? She's a lesbian.
- A what-bian?

161
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,940
- A plebeian?
- You don't know what a lesbian is?

162
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,910
Kenny?

163
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,250
- No, explain it to us, Chef.
- That's okay.

164
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,480
All you need to know
is Miss Ellen's a lesbian...

165
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,490
...and she only likes other lesbians.

166
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,660
Now move along, children.

167
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,190
Weak! She only likes lesbians?

168
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,930
If she only likes other lesbians,
then we gotta become lesbians too.

169
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,560
My grandma was Dutch-Irish
and my grandpa was lesbian.

170
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,680
- I'm a quarter lesbian.
- You're just saying that.

171
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,970
- You're not a lesbian.
- I am too!

172
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,180
- Okay, only a few more bandages to go.
- Well?

173
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,410
Take a look for yourself.

174
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,520
Wow, that's a pretty good nose job.
What do you think, Mr. Hat?

175
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,320
I think it looks great.

176
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,650
And without the swelling,
you'll really notice.

177
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,900
- What the hell are you doing?
- My mom said lesbians lick carpet.

178
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,440
- Really?
- I got an Indiglo Girls CD.

179
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,600
- The record store guy said to get it.
- I got these killer Birkenstocks.

180
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,350
I've been licking carpet for 3 hours,
and I don't feel like a lesbian!

181
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,400
- Hi, Mrs. Kimball.
- Howdy, Mr. Garrison.

182
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,370
Say, honey, you look
kind of different.

183
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,540
- Really?
- Did you get a haircut?

184
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,910
No, but thanks for asking.

185
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,980
Call me. I'm in the book.

186
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,210
Having a nose job is better
than I thought.

187
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,320
A whole world of opportunity
is opening up.

188
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,130
- Thanks for coming.
- That's okay.

189
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,460
I brought my makeup kit.
What are we doing?

190
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,790
That substitute won't stop
until she takes everything from me.

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,130
- Really?
- What I'd like to do...

192
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,000
...is load her into a rocket
and have her shot into the sun.

193
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,740
Instead, I'll just get Stan
to notice me.

194
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,510
- Bebe, I need a makeover.
- Cool.

195
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,480
Wait until she sees
what a lesbian I am.

196
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,880
- I'm a bigger lesbian.
- You're a fatter lesbian.

197
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,220
- Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian.
- Is that Wendy Testaburger?

198
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,760
Hi, what's up?

199
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,560
Wendy looks like that chick
from Grease, Elton John.

200
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,830
- Wow. Hi, Wendy.
- Hi, Stan.

201
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,640
- I think it worked, Bebe.
- Yeah.

202
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,870
- Good morning, children.
- Wow!

203
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,050
Wendy, you wore black leather too.

204
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,380
- We're like sisters.
- Die!

205
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,490
I finished grading your papers.

206
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,000
- The person with the highest score is...
- Hello there, children.

207
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,630
- Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
- Weak!

208
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,610
Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!
He's back. Mr. Garrison is back!

209
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,720
So long, don't let the door
hit your ass on the way out.

210
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,910
I have a very important announcement.
I'm quitting my job as a teacher.

211
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,150
- What?
- Suddenly I feel really confident.

212
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,020
I've decided to quit and do
what I've always dreamed of:

213
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,100
- Hang out and screw hot chicks.
- You can't.

214
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,830
The good new is,
I've talked to Principal Victoria...

215
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,270
...and Miss Ellen can stay on
as your permanent teacher.

216
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,540
- Really?
- That's right. Will you stay?

217
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,810
- Well, sure.
- No! No!

218
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,610
And the person who scored highest
on the quiz...

219
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,490
...and gets to have dinner on me
is Stan.

220
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,720
- Kick-ass.
- No! No!

221
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:19,660
Wendy, we just got a call
in the office. Your grandma just died.

222
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,500
My, what an exciting day.

223
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,140
- You're looking great.
- I'm a lady-killer, Mr. Hat.

224
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,880
- You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
- Just a few hundred more shots.

225
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,390
- A few hundred?
- That's the life of a model, baby.

226
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,030
- I'm gonna need some more smack.
- You got it!

227
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm very glad we could have dinner.
I really care about your education.

228
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,370
- Are we making love now?
- Excuse me?

229
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,140
There's no fireplace.
We shouldn't be making love yet.

230
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,640
Chef says you have
to make love by the fire.

231
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,340
I'm your teacher. We're only friends.

232
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,320
- But why?
- First of all, you're 8.

233
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,390
- It's because I'm not a lesbian.
- Oh, boy.

234
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,190
It's over. I give up.

235
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,340
Boy, Mr. Hat, being hot and sexy is fun
for a while, but it does get boring.

236
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,600
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

237
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,750
What the...?

238
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,080
Whoa! Hey, wait, wait!

239
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,020
Mr. Hat, save yourself!

240
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,780
- How'd it go?
- Did you make love?

241
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,980
- I think so.
- No way!

242
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,560
Down by the fire?

243
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,860
- Did I what?
- Good morning, children.

244
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,830
- Miss Ellen, can I talk to you?
- Can it wait till after class?

245
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,700
No, I have to apologize
for the way I've been acting.

246
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,600
- That's okay, Wendy.
- No, it's not.

247
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,900
Since you're staying,
I hope we can be friends.

248
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:17,250
- Well, I would love that, Wendy.
- And I want to apologize to everybody.

249
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,080
The way I acted was wrong,
and I've learned from it.

250
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,420
I just wish Stan and Miss Ellen
all the happiness in the world.

251
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,260
- There's nothing between me and Stan.
- That's not what we just heard.

252
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,500
Mr. Hat, I hate this.
I wish I'd never had a nose job.

253
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,700
Damn this beautiful face of mine.
Damn it to hell!

254
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:50,180
We have to get the surgery again,
Mr. Hat. I wanna be the old me again.

255
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,420
Okay, let's catch up
on our cursive handwriting.

256
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,220
- Down! Down! Everybody down!
- What the hell?

257
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,360
- So we meet again, Miss Ellen.
- Just what is going on here?

258
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,540
I am Hakeem Kurashki
of the nation of Iraq.

259
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,970
- She is a traitor.
- It's a lie!

260
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,080
She has killed thousands
and will kill again.

261
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,940
- Miss Ellen, is this true?
- No!

262
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,980
We must take her back to Iraq!

263
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,240
- Cool!
- Principal Victoria, please.

264
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,410
Here is Miss Ellen and our leader.
Her name is Makesh Alaq Makarakesh.

265
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,290
Well, you certainly tried to put one
over on us, boy howdy.

266
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,400
- Take her away!
- No, get away from me!

267
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,970
- Oh, my God, she killed Kenny!
- You bastard!

268
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,610
Wow, what incredible irony.

269
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,150
I can't believe she was
a criminal Iraqi fugitive.

270
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,050
- Yeah, you just never know.
- I guess I'm sorry I was ignoring you.

271
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,220
Happy Valentine's Day, Stan.

272
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,890
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay, Stan.

273
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,470
- Everything's okay.
- Are you still trying to be a lesbian?

274
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,230
My mom says all I have to do
is chow on this box.

275
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,520
For crimes against this country,
you are to be shot into the sun.

276
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,320
This is all a mistake.
This can't be happening.

277
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,660
- Please, for the love of God!
- Shut up!

278
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,530
Great party, Wendy.

279
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,000
Thanks, Mrs. Kimball.
Thanks for getting Mr. Garrison back.

280
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,410
- Anything for you, sugar pie.
- Hi, Kyle.

281
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,570
- This whole outcome is pretty strange.
- Excuse me.

282
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,130
How was Miss Ellen
suddenly arrested for...?

283
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,960
It's time to whip out
the eclipse shoeboxes!

284
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,540
- Bye-bye, Miss Ellen.
- Wendy, you didn't!

285
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,710
I told her...

286
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,540
...don't f* * * with Wendy Testaburger!
